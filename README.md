======================= LLM Generate_Response =======================
Ave Mujica is a Japanese all-girl band within the BanG Dream! franchise (Source 1, Source 2). They debuted on April 11, 2023, with the song "Kuro no Birthday" (Source 1). An anime featuring Ave Mujica is set to begin airing on January 2, 2025 (Source 2).

The band consists of five members (Source 1, Source 2):

*   **Doloris / Uika Misumi:** Guitarist, Vocalist (Source 1, Source 2). Portrayed by Sasaki Riko (Source 1).
*   **Mortis / Mutsumi Wakaba:** Guitarist (Source 1, Source 2). Portrayed by Watase Yuzuki (Source 1).
*   **Timoris / Umiri Yahata:** Bassist (Source 1, Source 2). Portrayed by Okada Mei (Source 1).
*   **Amoris / Nyamu Yutenji:** Drummer (Source 1, Source 2). Portrayed by Akane Yonezawa (Source 1).
*   **Oblivionis / Sakiko Togawa:** Keyboardist (Source 1, Source 2). Portrayed by Takao Kanon (Source 1).

The band was formed by Sakiko Togawa (Oblivionis), the keyboardist and leader of the now-disbanded CRYCHIC. She recruited members from diverse backgrounds to create Ave Mujica, aiming for a quick major debut (Source 2).

The members use stage names (Doloris, Mortis, Timoris, Amoris, Oblivionis), which are derived from features of the Moon's surface, specifically lunar lacūs ("lakes") and one sinus ("bay") (Source 2). The members' surnames are based on railway stations across Japan (Source 2). Ave Mujica's name derives from "Ave Musica," which means "Hail the Music" in Latin (Source 2).

For the song of the same name, see Ave Mujica (song).\n| “ | Welcome... to the world of Ave Mujica. | ” |\nAve Mujica is an all-girl band in the BanG Dream! franchise. The group consists of five members, namely Misumi Uika (Doloris) on lead guitar and vocals, Wakaba Mutsumi (Mortis) on rhythm guitar, Yahata Umiri (Timoris) on bass, Yuutenji Nyamu (Amoris) on drums, and Togawa Sakiko (Oblivionis) on keyboard.\nSimilarly to MyGO!!!!! before MyGO!!!!! 4th LIVE, Ave Mujica's band members were unknown and hid their faces while performing. During Ave Mujica 0th LIVE, they also wore cloaks until the last song. In-universe the members' identities were revealed during the 13th episode of BanG Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!, while their voice actresses made tweets officially announcing themselves as Ave Mujica's members after the episode's airing.\nOn September 14, 2023, it was announced that Ave Mujica would be getting their own anime.[1] On October 17, 2024, it was announced that the anime would start airing on January 2, 2025.\nBackground[]\nAve Mujica is a band crafted by Sakiko, or Oblivionis, the keyboardist and leader of the now disbanded CRYCHIC. It comprises of 5 members coming from various but seemingly alike backgrounds, either coming from a wealthy family, being the daughter of celebrities or being celebrities themselves. After the young woman seemingly broke, leading to CRYCHIC's disbandment, it appears that Sakiko has decided to create another band from the ground up, grabbing 2 of her childhood friends and 2 other people with her to create Ave Mujica.\nSakiko invited each member individually, contacting them to meet her before offering them to join the band. She aimed to make their band the band with the quickest major debut.[2]\nSongs[]\n- Kuro no Birthday\n- Futatsu no Tsuki ~Deep Into The Forest~\n- Choir ‘S’ Choir\n- Kamisama, Baka\n- Mas?uerade Rhapsody Re?uest\n- Ave Mujica (song)\n- Subarashiki Sekai demo Dokonimonai Basho\n- Angles\n- Symbol I: △\n- Symbol II: 🜁\n- Symbol III: ▽\n- Symbol IV: 🜃\n- Ether\n- KiLLKiSS\n- Georgette Me, Georgette You\n- DIVINE\n- Imprisoned XII\n- Crucifix X\n- Hachibousei Dance\n- Kao\n- Sora no Música\nLives/Events[]\n- Ave Mujica 0th LIVE\n- Ave Mujica 1st LIVE\n- Ave Mujica 2nd LIVE\n- Ave Mujica 3rd LIVE\n- Ave Mujica 4th LIVE\n- Ave Mujica Special Live \"KiLLKiSS\"\n- Wakaremichi no, Sono Saki e (with MyGO!!!!!)\n- Ave Mujica 5th LIVE\n- BanG Dream! 10th Anniversary LIVE\nVideos[]\nTrivia[]\n- Ave Mujica's name derives from \"Ave Musica\", which in Latin means \"Hail the Music\".\n- Ave Maria (Hail Mary) is a traditional Christian prayer addressed to the mother of Christ.\n- Mujina is the Japanese word for \"badger,\" trickster animals aligned with tanuki and kitsune.\n- Musically, Ave Mujika is officially described by both the creators and music media as an all-female heavy metal or gothic metal band. Since the franchise already had a band that performed music in these genres, it was decided at the concept stage to give the band a deeper, more emotionally passionate and visually striking concept to further distinguish it.[4]\n- They are the second band in the series whose members use stage names.\n- Kitschy and creepy, yet thrilling and cute, the band's visual aesthetic was inspired by the iconic director of macabre films, Tim Burton.[4]\n- The members' surnames (Misumi, Wakaba, Yahata, Yuutenji, and Togawa) are all based on railway stations found across Japan.\n- The members' stage names are derived from the features of the Moon's surface, similar in nature to the larger lunar maria (\"Moon seas\"): four lacūs (singular: lacus, plural: lacūs) (\"lakes\") and one sinus (singular: sinus, plural: sinūs) (\"bay\"). Lunar maria are large, dark basaltic plains on the Moon that were formed by lava flowing into ancient impact basins. They were called maria (singular: mare, plural: maria) by early astronomers who mistook them for actual seas.\n- Doloris — named after Lacus Doloris, meaning \"Lake of Sorrow\".\n- Mortis — named after Lacus Mortis, meaning \"Lake of Death\".\n- Timoris — named after Lacus Timoris, meaning \"Lake of Fear\".\n- Amoris — named after Sinus Amoris, meaning \"Bay of Love\".\n- Oblivionis — named after Lacus Oblivionis, meaning \"Lake of Forgetfulness\".\nReferences[]\nExternal Links[]\n- https://bang-dream.com/avemujica\n- https://avemujica.bang-dream.com/\n- https://twitter.com/bdp_avemujica\n- https://twitter.com/bangdream_en\n- https://twitter.com/bangdream_la\n- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrWC59UUMETuCp9IYUdjVbg\n- https://lin.ee/d7B7l5p\n- https://m.blog.naver.com/PostList.naver?blogId=bang_dream_kr&tab=1 - Official Ave Mujica Korean blog\n[]\n|",
